# node-manta Changelog

## not yet released

- joyent/node-manta#333 The --role-tag option does not work for mput, muntar,
  mln, or mmkdir
- joyent/node-manta#329 Refactor all commands to use common option parsing code
- joyent/node-manta#343 Add `mjob wait` as an alias to `mjob watch`.
- add "msign -s" argument to shorten signed urls using the https://i.no.de
  service.

## 5.1.1

- joyent/node-manta#315 document mlogin session termination conditions

## 5.1.0

Minor version bump due to a backwards-compatible addition to the multipart
upload client operations. The client operations now allow for a
`partsDirectory` string on the options object for multipart upload methods,
which is used as the URL of the request. Otherwise, the parts directory is
resolved using the server's redirect endpoint.

- joyent/node-manta#325 ask server for fully qualified upload path
- joyent/node-manta#326 client could support accepting fully qualified upload
  directory as input to MPU operations

## 5.0.0

If you do not check explicitly for `ResourceNotFoundErrors` from multipart
upload operations, this major bump will not affect you. Code that checks for a
`ResourceNotFoundError` in the error cause chain using
[VError](https://github.com/joyent/node-verror)'s `findCauseByName` or
`hasCauseWithName` will continue to work.

Major bump due to a change in the errors that may be returned from client
multipart upload operations. In particular, if Manta returns a
`ResourceNotFoundError` for an MPU operation, it is presumed that the Manta
deployment does not have the multipart upload API enabled. The client will now
return a `FeatureNotSupportedError` from the methods `createUpload`,
`uploadPart`, `abortUpload`, `getUpload`, and `commitUpload` in this case, with
the `ResourceNotFoundError` preserved in the call chain.
Code that specifically checks for the error name `ResourceNotFoundError` to
detect whether multipart upload is supported should be updated appropriately
to use VError.hasCauseWithName.

- joyent/node-manta#320 client should detect if MPU is enabled
- joyent/node-manta#319 MPU-related tests should detect if MPU is supported

## 4.5.0

Minor bump due to a backwards-compatible addition to the `commitUpload` method
on the client. The `commitUpload` method now passes the response from the server
to the callback.

- joyent/node-manta#323 return response argument from client.commitUpload
- joyent/node-manta#318 node-manta nodejs version support
- joyent/node-manta#322 test7 make target should be test8 given node v8
- joyent/node-manta#321 document mlogin's use of poseidon assets

## 4.4.3

- joyent/node-manta#244 mlogin could disable Manta's abort-on-core behavior

## 4.4.2

- joyent/node-manta#312 Custom header input should tolerate ':' characters

## 4.4.1

- joyent/node-manta#302 Create a manual page for `mmpu`
- joyent/node-manta#311 `createUpload` incorrectly handles some target object headers

## 4.4.0

- joyent/node-manta#308 `mmpu commit` does not parse options
- joyent/node-manta#309 MPU tests are out of sync with Muskie master branch implementation

## 4.3.0

- MANTA-2169: Support multipart upload of a single file to Manta

## 4.2.0

Minor bump due to relaxation of API requirements in `mfind` (NotFound
errors are no longer fatal unless none of the arguments are found)

- joyent/node-manta#230 Allow redirection of `mlogin` debug log output on
  `stderr`; e.g., `LOG_LEVEL=trace mlogin -v 2> >(bunyan -o short)`.
- joyent/node-manta#298 mjob-simple fails because of GNU date regression
- joyent/node-manta#281 mfind NotFound errors should not be fatal

## 4.1.1

- joyent/node-manta#293 '~~/' works, '~~' does now too.
- joyent/node-manta#294 content-length and transfer-encoding chunked must not
  be used together

## 4.1.0

- joyent/node-manta#214 Add basic Bash completion for the `m*` tools.
  "Basic" here means options and mjob subcommands are completed, not
  yet support for completing manta paths.
- joyent/node-manta#288 mfind of file blows assertion: "ent (object) is required"

## 4.0.0

- joyent/node-manta#272 Add `--version` to all tools
- *BREAKING CHANGE* joyent/node-manta#282 `mchmod` now parses all standard
  options. The use of the `--` form is encouraged to avoid ambiguities in role
  versus option names (ex: `mchmod -- -read,write ~~/stor/foo.txt`).
  This is a breaking change for some ambiguous invocations of mchmod that worked
  by accident before. For example this:
        mchmod -read,write ~~/stor/foo.txt      # worked before, fails in v4
        mchmod -- -read,write ~~/stor/foo.txt   # works in both major versions
- joyent/node-manta#280 Ensure that `--disk`, `--memory`, and `--init`
  options are used with `mjob create MAP_PHASE ^ MAP_PHASE ^^ REDUCE_PHASE`
  style job creation.
- joyent/node-manta#279 Improvements to help output for all CLIs.
  Also add the `mjob create --dry-run ...` option to print the created
  job object and exit. This is useful for exploring and testing `mjob create`s
  many options.

## 3.1.3

- joyent/node-manta#277 mjob fails with "mjob: AssertionError: body (object) is required"

## 3.1.2

- joyent/node-manta#275 msign with subusers broken
- joyent/node-manta#270 Add -p to `man mput`

## 3.1.1

- joyent/node-manta#261 "AssertionError: undefined (object) is required" after
  "socket hang up"

## 3.1.0

- joyent/node-manta#265 Add `--json, -j` option to `mfind`. E.g.:

        $ mfind -j ~~/stor/tmp
        {"name":"foo-file.gz","etag":"142ad91b-73d8-6cb4-9cd9-efacf7df7a9a","size":229535627,"type":"object","mtime":"2014-10-08T22:53:25.146Z","durability":2,"parent":"/trent.mick/stor/tmp","depth":0}
        {"name":"foo.imgmanifest","etag":"88ac47b9-e53f-c065-b446-e2d0455c0c00","size":1052,"type":"object","mtime":"2014-10-08T22:52:44.298Z","durability":2,"parent":"/trent.mick/stor/tmp","depth":0}

## 3.0.0

- joyent/node-manta#246 Update many dependencies to support node v4 and v6
  without build errors or warnings.
  This involved dropping support for node 0.8. It is for this reason, and
  prudence at the large number of dependency updates (many of them across
  major version bumps) that we are doing a major version bump of this package.
  For node >=0.10 users there aren't any *known* backwards incompatibilities.
- MANTA-2937: mchmod client-side workaround for MANTA-2929 InvalidUpdateError

## 2.0.7

- joyent/node-manta#252 2.0.6 breaks msign with ssh-agent and RSA keys

## 2.0.6

- joyent/node-manta#250 msign should let smartdc-auth decide what algorithm
  to use. Fixes msign with ECDSA keys (so the -g option is no longer needed)

## 2.0.5

- PUBAPI-1214 update smartdc-auth to sshpk-agent 1.2.1, to fix a number of
  bad-state issues arising when using node-manta under heavy load with the
  ssh-agent

## 2.0.4

- MANTA-2812, PUBAPI-1197 fix up support for custom request signers, and
  handle "null signers" properly (prevent the generation of an Authorization
  header)

## 2.0.3

- Updated smartdc-auth version, eliminates duplicated code from http-signature

## 2.0.2

- Updated smartdc-auth version for repeatable builds.

## 2.0.1

## 2.0.0

  with the SSH agent. The loadSSHKey method is known to be incompatible,
  but other auth-related API is preserved.
